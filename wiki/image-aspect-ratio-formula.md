To find the height of the image when the width is set to 500 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio, you can use the following formula:

\[ \text{Height} = \frac{\text{New Width} \times \text{Original Height}}{\text{Original Width}} \]

Given that the original width is 898 pixels and the original height is 713 pixels, and you want to set the new width to 500 pixels:

\[ \text{Height} = \frac{500 \times 713}{898} \]

\[ \text{Height} = \frac{356500}{898} \]

\[ \text{Height} â‰ˆ 397.22 \]

So, if you assign a width of 500 pixels to the image, the height will be approximately 397.22 pixels to maintain the original aspect ratio.
