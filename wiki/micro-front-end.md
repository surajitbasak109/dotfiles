Enter “micro frontends,” a solution that brings agility and scalability to the front end of web applications.

In this blog post, we’ll be taking a look at what micro frontends are, what are their key concepts, what are the types of micro frontends, and much more. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just beginning your web development career, understanding micro frontends can take your projects to the next level of flexibility and efficiency. So, let’s dive in!

**Evolution of micro frontends**

The term “micro frontends” debuted in the 2016 ThoughtWorks Technology Radar guide. This guide highlights emerging [software development trends](https://www.turing.com/blog/software-development-trends/) and changes that pique industry experts’ interest. As the guide suggests, web applications were becoming more substantial, with frontends gaining prominence while the backend’s significance waned.

The traditional monolithic approach, designed to handle smaller web applications, proved cumbersome for these new, sprawling projects.

**What are micro frontends?**
------------------------------

At its core, micro frontends extend the philosophy of microservices to the front end of web applications. Microservices, a well-established architectural pattern, divide the backend into separate services, each responsible for a specific function. This modular approach ensures scalability, agility, and fault tolerance.

Micro frontends apply the same principles to the front end, breaking down a web application into smaller, autonomous modules or functions. Each module can be developed independently, providing frontend teams with a level of flexibility and speed akin to what microservices offer to their backend counterparts.

Key concepts of micro frontends

To implement micro frontends effectively, it’s crucial to delve deeper into their two fundamental principles:

1.  ### **Independent development**

    Development teams can operate as autonomous units within a larger project with micro frontends. Each micro frontend module behaves as a self-contained entity, responsible for a specific feature or function.

    **Advantages:**
    *   **Faster iterations:** Teams can iterate and release updates independently, accelerating the development process.
    *   **Reduced bottlenecks:** With fewer inter-team dependencies, the overall development pipeline becomes more streamlined.
    *   **Specialized skills:** Developers can hone their skills and become experts in their micro frontend’s domain, fostering innovation and creativity.

2.  ### **Module autonomy**

    Each module is designed to be self-sufficient and self-reliant. These modules don’t need to rely on other parts of the application to function correctly. This level of autonomy extends to both the development and runtime aspects of micro frontends.

    **Advantages:**
    *   **Isolation of failures:** If one module encounters issues or needs updates, it can be addressed without affecting the stability of the entire application.
    *   **Enhanced scalability:** The modular nature of micro frontends makes it easier to scale specific components to meet increased demand.
    *   **Flexibility in technology stacks:** Teams can select the most suitable technology stack for their micro frontend without being constrained by choices made elsewhere in the application.

**Types of micro frontends**
----------------------------

Micro frontends come in various forms, each offering a distinct approach to modularization. Choosing the right type can significantly impact the development, maintainability, and scalability of your web application. Here are the three primary types:

1.  ### **Monorepository**

    In this setup, all micro frontend projects reside within a single repository. While this may seem counterintuitive to the microservices philosophy, it offers some unique advantages. Within the monorepository, there are distinct subfolders for each micro frontend project.

    **Advantages:**
    *   **Centralized dependencies:** All micro frontends share the same system of dependencies, simplifying version control and management.
    *   **Easier collaboration:** Developers have visibility into all projects within the repository, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.
    *   **Consistent tooling:** Standardized tooling and configurations can be applied across all micro frontends.

        **Considerations:**
    *   **Potential for complexity:** As the number of micro frontends grows, managing a monorepository can become complex.
    *   **Build and deployment challenges:** Ensuring efficient builds and deployments for all micro frontends can be challenging.

2.  ### **Multirepository**

    In the multirepository approach, each micro frontend project resides in a separate repository. This isolation provides independent dependency systems for each project.

    **Advantages:**
    *   **Isolation:** Projects are entirely isolated, reducing the risk of conflicts and dependencies interfering with one another.
    *   **Decentralized development:** Teams have complete autonomy over their micro frontend projects, allowing for diverse technology stacks and development processes.
    *   **Scalability:** As the application grows, adding new micro frontends or teams is straightforward.

        **Considerations:**
    *   **Integration complexity:** Coordinating the integration of multiple repositories can be more challenging than managing a monorepository.
    *   **Dependency versioning:** Ensuring compatibility of dependencies across multiple repositories can require careful version management.

3.  ### **Metarepository**

    The metarepository strategy seeks to strike a balance between monorepositories and multirepositories. It involves having multiple repositories for individual micro frontends while also integrating them into one central repository.

    **Advantages:**
    *   **Flexibility:** Teams can work independently on their micro frontends in separate repositories, fostering autonomy.
    *   **Integration:** The central repository facilitates the integration of individual micro frontends, making it easier to create a unified application.

        **Considerations:**
    *   **Complexity:** Balancing the autonomy of individual repositories with the need for integration can introduce complexity.
    *   **Coordination:** Teams may still need to coordinate on common standards and integration points.

Choosing the right type of micro frontend architecture depends on your project’s specific requirements, team structure, and long-term goals. While monorepositories offer centralized control, multirepositories provide independence, and metarepositories aim to find a middle ground.

Evaluating your project’s needs and considering factors like team collaboration, scalability, and dependency management will help you choose the most suitable micro frontend approach.
