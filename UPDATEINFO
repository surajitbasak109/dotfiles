Playing Melodies
In Normal mode, we compose commands by typing one or more keystrokes
in sequence. These commands appear as follows:
NotationMeaning
xPress x once
dwIn sequence, press d , then w
dapIn sequence, press d , a , then p
Most of these sequences involve two or three keystrokes, but some are longer.
Deciphering the meaning of Vim’s Normal mode command sequences can be
challenging, but you’ll get better at it with practice.
